**Triage Note: Pt 10002**

**Chief Complaint:** Shortness of breath and feeling "puffy" after missing dialysis, with a known need for surgical intervention for appendicitis.

**History of Present Illness:** The patient reports missing dialysis yesterday and now presents with symptoms of shortness of breath and feeling "puffy", indicative of potential volume overload. Additionally, the patient has a known diagnosis of appendicitis requiring surgical intervention.

**Vital Signs:**

* Not currently available, but patient's symptoms suggest potential respiratory compromise and fluid overload.

**Assessment:**

1. **Urgent need for dialysis** to address fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
2. **Surgical evaluation** for appendicitis, which may need to be expedited given the patient's current condition.
3. **Respiratory status** requires close monitoring due to reported shortness of breath.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Immediate dialysis** to alleviate fluid overload and stabilize the patient.
2. **Surgical consultation** to assess the urgency of the appendicitis and determine the best course of action given the patient's current condition.
3. **Monitoring** of vital signs, particularly oxygen saturation and respiratory rate, to quickly identify any deterioration in the patient's condition.

**Priority Level:** High

This patient requires immediate attention to address both the urgent need for dialysis and the surgical intervention for appendicitis, while closely monitoring their respiratory status.
