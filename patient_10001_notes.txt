**URGENT - PRE-OP CONCERNS**

Pt 10001: I am extremely concerned about the patient's current status as we approach his scheduled gallbladder surgery. Upon assessment, I have observed large bruising on both of his arms, which is highly unusual and warrants immediate attention. When questioned about the bruising, the patient casually mentioned that he skipped his last clotting test, which was ordered to assess his coagulation status prior to surgery.

Given the patient's history and current presentation, I am worried about the risk of bleeding complications during and after surgery. The fact that he missed his clotting test means we do not have an up-to-date assessment of his coagulation status, which is crucial for safe surgical intervention.

I strongly recommend that we postpone the surgery until we can get the patient's clotting test results and reassess his overall condition. I have paged the surgeon and anesthesiologist to discuss this urgent matter and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I will continue to closely monitor the patient's condition and keep a close eye on his vital signs.

**VITAL SIGNS:**

* BP: 120/80
* HR: 100
* O2 Sat: 98% on room air

**LAB RESULTS:**

* Pending: clotting test results

**PLAN:**

* Postpone surgery until further notice
* Obtain stat clotting test results
* Consult with surgeon and anesthesiologist to determine best course of action
* Continue to monitor patient's condition closely

**NOTIFIED:**

* Surgeon: Dr. Smith
* Anesthesiologist: Dr. Johnson

I will continue to update this note as more information becomes available.
